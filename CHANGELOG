Changelog for hFRET project
===========================

HEAD
----
* Added load_traces.m: A function to load in one or more datasets, remove photobleaching, as well as traces below a minimum length. 

0.3 (still need to tag!)
------------------------

* get_ML_par: Parameter update for beta was based on wrong identity for mu_var. Previous update:

      beta = 1 /(mu_var*lambda_mean)
  
  New update:

      beta = 1 / (mu_var * W * (v-2))

* synth_data_hFRET_subpop: Generates a set of synthetic traces with parameters drawn from specified priors.

* Added hFRET_subpop.m: New script to detect subpopulations.
  1. Loads in traces from a number of '.dat' files (CSV format T rows, 2*N columns)
  2. Removes photobleaching from traces by calling _photobleach_index_
  3. Runs VBEM on each trace to get an initial set of output parameters for a number of states ranging from 1:K
  4. Runs _get_ML_par_ to construct first guess for hyperparameters _u_ for number of states running from 1:K
  5. For each configuration _s_, construct guesses for subpopulation hyperparameters by combining subblocks of guesses obtained in step 4
  6. Run 1:R hFRET iterations for each configuration _s_
     * Calculate max evidence parameters for each trace using VBEM
     * Calculate new hyperparameters from VBEM parameters using method of moments 

* Added hFRET_subpop_par.m and hFRET_subpop_cont.m: Parallelized version, and a script to resume a previously saved run.  

* Added photobleach_index: Script to detect photobleaching point in a donor or acceptor signal. 

  1. Calculates running average moving forward through trace
  2. Calculates running average running backward through trace
  3. Take deviation between signal and forward/backward average
  4. Look for correlated spike in deviation to identify bleaching point

* get_ML_par.m: Added optional argument LP for weighting of updates using evidence


0.2 (still need to tag!)
------------------------
* Created *util/* directory for supporting functions 
* Moved scripts into separate dir. Removed all non-essential files


0.1
---

* Initial Import of Jonbron's hFRET code
